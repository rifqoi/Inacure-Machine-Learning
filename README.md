## Documentation

1. Download zip dataset and put into your gdrive (when you running the model in collab) or download it directly to your project's folder
2. Unzip dataset
4. Build the CNN Model.
5. Train the model.
6. Evaluate the model by plotting the model performance graph.
7. Save the model into Tensorflow saved_model.

## Classes

There are 9 leaves classes that can be predicted:
1. Anggur
2. Apel
3. Ceri
4. Delima
5. Jamblang
6. Jambu Biji
